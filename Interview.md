1. Tell me about yourself.
    First of all my given name may be little hard to say. You can call me Jason instead. 
    I am a third-year undergraduate at SFU in the Dual Degree Program of Computer Science. I took first two years at Zhejiang University in China. Last semester was my first time coming to sfu.
    During my study at university, I've gain good command of fundamental skills in Computer Science and Mathematic. It can be seen by my GPA and grades. blablabla
    Besides, I also think of myself as a self-motivated person and a great self-learner. At spare time I started my self projects. Last year, I finished the web library system writen in PHP&MySQL and also started Wechat Mini App with Django backend. The wechat Mini app is a web app running on the wechat. In these projects, I self learned PHP,JavaScript, Django, and Apache2. I believe I can quickly learn new knowledge and fit into some new challenges or projects to me.
